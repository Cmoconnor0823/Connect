Then begin installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

```
npm start
```

<h3> Using KonnectD </h3>

When first landing on the site you will be taken to the log in page that also shows a brief about card that will tell you more about the app. If you do not already have an account, click on the Create Account link on the nav bar or the footer and proceed to fill out your information to create an app. Once you have your account return to the log in page and enter your information to be redirected to the home page. From here you will be able to see all users connected to your project, a place for you to log in and interact with your Google Calendar, a To Do list to help you stay on track, and a messaging board for you to connect with everyone on the project. When you have finished for the day, just log out and your information is saved for next time.
